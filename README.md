## Key features of this version

I have done a lot of work on this mission trying to fill some realistic gaps that I felt. This version of the mission is dependent on some addons, check the list bellow.
* Heavly integrated with ACE 3 (no modules, all done with scripts and configs),
* Class selector. You can change class during game when near a FOB,
* Class restrictions. Only pilots can fly and crew members can operate a tank,
* Weapons and items restrictions for each class,
* Player persistency (position, direction, stand, ace medical status, class, loadout),
* Better object handling when placing. You can place lighter objects on top of buildings,
* Ammo Factories to produce resources,
* Pushback sript for planes by Jack Ost,
* Integrated [TAA] Realistic Repair by [TAA]Jérôme with ACE 3 repair system,
* Integrated and heavly modified version of TFAR radio handler script by SENSEI,
* Pre-made squads with radio settings,
* And way more things!! Seriously, there's a lot of changes on this version.
